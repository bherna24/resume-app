     <!-- Puzzles have been a common pastime in my life. Be it jigsaw or 3D, I found the challenge of analyzing and connecting big-picture concepts by small and detailed steps entertaining. 
     I find the same enjoyment in data analysis, as it requires critical thinking to understand the big picture and attention to detail. I find particular curiosity in financial, education, and personality data.
    In my free time, I practice my electric guitar, photography, and I read fiction and non-fiction books to widen my knowledge and imagination. Did you know reading can help advance vocabulary as well? </p> -->

        Troubleshooting and debugging are my areas of strength. I am quick to learn and understand application stacks, and can debug in various environments. I enjoy dealing with data, be it cleaning, analyzing or updating; 
        I have exposure to SQL and NoSQL and web development using the angular framework. Besides continual learning, I spend time reading, practicing my electric guitar, and some photography.
